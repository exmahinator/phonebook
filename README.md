Simple phonebook application. Without special checks, logins etc.

To register yousrlf chose any email and any password - they are not going to storage anywhere. So even MyPseudoName@gmail.com and some password will allow you to use the application and check its simple functionality. Not perferct, but it's kind of my beginner's pet-project.

Email must be longer than 3 symbols and password must be more than 7 symbols with at least 1 uppercase letter, lovercase letter and digit.

Enjoy your time!
